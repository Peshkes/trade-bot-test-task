# Test Project README

## Overview
This is a test project demonstrating a dashboard with dynamic charts and mock data integration. The project uses React with Vite for development, JSON Server for mock API, and Recharts for data visualization.

## Getting Started

### Installation & Running

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
2. **Start mock API server (in separate terminal)**
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
This starts JSON Server on port 8000 with mock data from server/data.json

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
The application will be available at http://localhost:5173
